GOI is a whimsical app that exists purely for the sake of existing.

With a simple interface, you can input your mood, and the app will serve up quirky nuggets of wisdom and memes that make you question everything. It‚Äôs perfect for those moments when you just need a laugh or a reminder that sometimes, things don‚Äôt need to make sense‚Äîthey just are!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
GOI tackles the utterly absurd challenge of finding humor in life's mundane miseries. It offers a solution to the "seriousness" of daily struggles by providing hilariously offbeat advice when you least expect it. Whether you're overwhelmed by minor inconveniences or simply bored, this app delivers a dose of laughable wisdom that reminds you that life doesn‚Äôt always need a purpose‚Äîit can just be delightfully silly!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
GOI tackles life‚Äôs silly dilemmas by serving up absurd advice and hilarious memes based on your selected "pain level." Just choose how you‚Äôre feeling, and the app delivers a dose of laughter and quirky wisdom.
